# TTS multi-page assignment

### First major project
This was my first major project under TTS until I become a full-stack developer. 

### My Personal Challenges
I was having a hard time trying to make the cart logo appear on the right side of the navigation bar

### Random Unexpected Challenges
ïƒ˜An unexpected challenge that I had was that the second and third page's navigation bar looked different from the home page.

### Solutions
I realized that I had an unnecessary div class tag for the second and third page hints why they looked different from the home page.

### Weakness so far
1.	flexbox is my weakness
